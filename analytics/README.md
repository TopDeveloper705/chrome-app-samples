# Analytics

This example demonstrates how to include support for Google Analytics in your
packaged application. It uses the 
[chrome-platform-analytics](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-platform-analytics) library,
which allows tracking app views or any arbitrary event to Google Analytics.
Offline is also supported. See more at the [project wiki](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-platform-analytics/wiki)

*Please note: You will need to modify main.js to include real Google Analytics credentials.*
